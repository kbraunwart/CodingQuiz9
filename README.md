Mini Max Sum Time Complexity:
O(n) as a for loop is needed to iterate through each integer in the array

Mini Max Sum Space Complexity:
O(c) as a constant number of variables are used to hold
long and int values throughout the code.

Weighted Uniform Strings Time Complexity:
O(n) as two for loops are used to iterate through the
characters in s and each query in query, and O(2n) ~ O(n)

Weighted Uniform Strings Space Complexity:
O(n) as the the list results is created to store
n (the amount of queries) strings.
